## The word Web Development is made up of two words, that is: <br>

Web: It refers to websites, web pages or anything that works over the internet.<br>
Development: It refers to building the application from scratch. <br><br><br>


## Web Development can be classified into two ways:

Frontend Development<br>
Backend Development<br><br>


### Frontend Development

HTML: HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is used to design the front end portion of web pages using markup language. It acts as a skeleton for a website since it is used to make the structure of a website.</p> <br>
<p> CSS: Cascading Style Sheets fondly referred to as CSS is a simply designed language intended to simplify the process of making web pages presentable. It is used to style our website.</p> <br>
<p> JavaScript: JavaScript is a scripting language used to provide a dynamic behavior to our website.<br>
Bootstrap: Bootstrap is a free and open-source tool collection for creating responsive websites and web applications. It is the most popular CSS framework for developing responsive, mobile-first websites.
